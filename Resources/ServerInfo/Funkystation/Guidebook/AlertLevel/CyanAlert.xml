  Only destroy borgs if they pose a direct threat to the safety of the personnel.

  [bold]Science:[/bold]

  Roboticists are required to turn borgs back to Crewsimov or NT Default lawsets;
  
  The Research Director or roboticist should disable all borgs with their console;

  If the AI is malfunctioning, the Research Director should try to download the AI's consciousness onto their Intellicard.
